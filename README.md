# Cohort Analysis

A cohort is a collection of users who have something in common. A traditional cohort, for example, divides people by the week or month in which they were first acquired. When referring to non-time-dependent groupings, the term segment is often used instead of cohort.

The majority of organizations use Cohort Analysis to track and improve the Retention Rate and reduce the Churn Rate of the users of their services or products.
